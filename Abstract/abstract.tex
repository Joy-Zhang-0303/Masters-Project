\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
I will introduce the topic of representation theory of finite groups and give some examples.  We'll then discuss complete 
reducibility and Mashcke's theorem, Schur's Lemma, and the Isotypical Decomposition.  Finally we will define the character table 
of a representation and compute the character tables of $D_3$ and $D_4$.
