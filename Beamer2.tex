% Since this a solution template for a generic talk, very little can

% of between 15min and 45min and the theme suggest that you stick to
% the following rules:  

% - Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per frame. So there should be between about
%   15 and 30 frames, all told.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection[Short First Subsection Name]{First Subsection Name}

\begin{frame}{Group Representations}
Groups arise naturally as sets of symmetries of some object which are closed under composition and taking inverses.   \pause For example, 
\begin{enumerate}
\item The \textbf{symmetric group} of degree $n$, $S_n$, is the group of all symmetries of the set $\{ 1, \ldots, n \}$. \pause
\item The \textbf{dihedral group} of order $2n$, $D_{n}$, is the group of all symmetries of the regular $n$-gon in the plane.
\end{enumerate}
\pause
One may wonder more generally:  Given an abstract group $G$, which objects $X$ does $G$ act on?
This is the basic question of representation theory, which attempts to classify all such $X$ up to isomorphism.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Group Actions}
\begin{defn}\label{def-grp-action}
A  \textbf{\textit{(left)} group action} of a group $G$ on a set $X$ is a map $\rho \colon G \times X \to X$ (written as $g \cdot a$, for all $g \in G$ and $a \in A$) that satisfies the following two axoims:
\begin{align}
\label{grp-action-axiom-1}&1 \cdot  x = x && \forall x \in X\\
\label{grp-action-axiom-2}&(gh) \cdot x  = g \cdot (h \cdot x) && \forall g,h \in G, x \in X
\end{align}
\end{defn}
\begin{note}
We could likewise define the concept of a \textit{right} group action, where the set elements would be multiplied by group elements on the right instead of on the left.  Throughout we shall use the term \textit{group action} to mean a \textit{left} group action.
\end{note}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The Definition of a Representation}
\begin{defn}\label{rep-def-2}Let $G$ be a group, let $F$ be a field, and let $V$ be a vector space over $F$. A \textbf{linear representation} of $G$ is an action of $G$ on $V$ which preserves the linear structure of $V$, i.e. an action of $G$ on $V$ such that
\begin{align}
\label{rep-axiom-1}&g \cdot (v_1+v_2)=g \cdot v_1+g \cdot v_2 \quad && \forall g \in G, v_1, v_2 \in V \\
\label{rep-axiom-2}&g \cdot (kv) = k (g \cdot v) \quad && \forall g \in G, v \in V, k \in F
\end{align}
\end{defn}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The Definition of a Representation}
\begin{defn}[Alternative definition]
\label{rep-def-1}
Let $G$ be a group, let $F$ be a field, and let $V$ be a vector space over $F$.  A \textbf{linear representation} of G is any group homomorphism $\rho\colon G \to GL(V)$. If we fix a basis for $V$, we get a representation in the previous sense.\end{defn}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Make Titles Informative.}

  You can create overlays\dots
  \begin{itemize}
  \item using the \texttt{pause} command:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      First item.
      \pause
    \item    
      Second item.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    using overlay specifications:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item<3->
      First item.
    \item<4->
      Second item.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    using the general \texttt{uncover} command:
    \begin{itemize}
      \uncover<5->{\item
        First item.}
      \uncover<6->{\item
        Second item.}
    \end{itemize}

    The \alert{second main message} of your talk in one or two lines.
  \item
    Perhaps a \alert{third message}, but not more than that.
