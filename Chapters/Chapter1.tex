\section {Group Actions}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{defn}\label{def-grp-action}
A  \textbf{\textit{(left)} group action} of a group $G$ on a set $X$ is a map $\rho \colon G \times X \to X$ (written as $g \cdot a$, for all $g \in G$ and $a \in A$) that satisfies the following two axoims:
\begin{align}
\label{grp-action-axiom-1}&1 \cdot  x = x && \forall x \in X\\
\label{grp-action-axiom-2}&(gh) \cdot x  = g \cdot (h \cdot x) && \forall g,h \in G, x \in X
\end{align}
\end{defn}
\begin{note}
We could likewise define the concept of a \textit{right} group action, where the set elements would be multiplied by group elements on the right instead of on the left.  Throughout we shall use the term \textit{group action} to mean a \textit{left} group action.
\end{note}


\begin{prop}\label{sigma-is-a-permutation}
Let $G$ act on the set $X$.  For any fixed $g \in G$, the map $\sigma_g$ from $X$ into $X$ defined by $\sigma_g (x) = g \cdot x$ is a \textit{permutation} of the set $X$.  That is, $\sigma_g \in S_X$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
We show that $\sigma_g$ is a permutation of $X$ by finding a two-sided inverse map, namely $\sigma_{g^{-1}}$. Observe that for any $x \in X$, we have
\begin{align*}
(\sigma_{g^{-1}} \circ \sigma_g) (x) &= \sigma_{g^{-1}} ( \sigma_g (x)  \\
					&= g^{-1} \cdot (g \cdot x) && \text{(by definition of $\sigma_g$ and $\sigma_{g^{-1}}$)} \\
					&= (g^{-1}g) \cdot x &&\text{(by axiom \ref{grp-action-axiom-1} of an action)} \\
					&= 1 \cdot x \\
					&= x &&\text{(by axiom \ref{grp-action-axiom-2} of an action)}.
\end{align*}
Thus $\sigma_{g^{-1}} \circ \sigma_g$ is the identity map on $X$. We can reverse the roles of $g$ and $g^{-1}$ to see that $\sigma_g \circ \sigma_{g^{-1}}$ is also the identity map on $X$.  Having a two-sided inverse, we conclude that $\sigma_g$ is a permutation of $X$.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}\label{action-yields-hom}
Let $G$ act on the set $X$. The map from $G$ into the symmetric group $S_X$ defined by $g \mapsto \sigma_g (x) = g \cdot x$ is a group homomorphism.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Define the map $\rho \colon G \to S_X$ by $\rho (g) = \sigma_g$.  We have seen from Proposition \ref{sigma-is-a-permutation} that $\sigma_g$ is indeed an element of $S_X$.  It remains to show that $\rho(g_1 g_2) = \rho(g_1) \circ \rho(g_2)$ for any $g_1, g_2 \in G$.  Observe that

\begin{align*}
\rho(g_1 g_2)(x) &= \sigma_{g_1 g_2} (x) && \text{(by definition of $\rho$)} \\
			&= (g_1 g_2) \cdot x && \text{(by definition of $\sigma_{g_1 g_2}$)} \\
			&= g_1 \cdot (g_2 \cdot x) && \text{(by axiom \ref{grp-action-axiom-1} of an action)} \\
			&= \sigma_{g_1} ( \sigma_{g_2} (x)) && \text{(by definition of $\sigma_{g_1}$ and  $\sigma{g_2}$)} \\
			&= \rho(g_1) ( \rho(g_2) (x)) && \text{(by definition of $\rho$)}\\
			&= (\rho(g_1) \circ \rho(g_2)) (x) && \text{(by definition of function composition)}.
\end{align*}
Since the values of $\rho(g_1 g_2)$ and $\rho(g_1) \circ \rho(g_2)$ agree on every element $x \in X$, these two permutations are equal. We conclude that $\rho$ is a homomorphism, since $g_1$ and $g_2$ were arbitrary elements of $G$.
\end{proof}


\begin{prop} \label{hom-yields-action}
Any homomorphism $\psi$ from the group $G$ into the symmetric group $S_X$ on a set $X$ gives rise to an action of $G$ on $X$, defined by taking $g \cdot x = \psi(g)(x)$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Suppose  that we have a homomorphism $\psi$ from $G$ into $S_X$.  We can define a map from $G \times X$ to $X$  by $g \cdot x = \psi(g)(x)$. We verify that this map satisfies the definition of a group action of $G$ on $X$:
\\ (axiom \ref{grp-action-axiom-1}) \quad $1 \cdot x = \psi(1)(x) = id_X(x) = x$
\\(axiom \ref{grp-action-axiom-2}) \quad $(gh) \cdot x = \psi(gh)(x) = (\psi(g)\psi(h))(x) = \psi(g)(\psi(h)(x)) = g \cdot (h \cdot x)$
\end{proof}

\begin{cor} \label{equivalence-of-actions}
The actions of $G$ on the set $X$ are in bijective correspondence with the homomorphisms from $G$ into the symmetric group $S_X$.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
By Proposition \ref{action-yields-hom}, any action of $G$ on $X$ yields a homomorphism from $G$ into $S_X$.    Conversely, any homomorphism from $G$ into $S_X$ establishes an action of $G$ on $X$ by Proposition \ref{hom-yields-action}.
\end{proof}

%	The Definition of a Representation
%
\section{The Definition of a Representation}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{defn}
Let $G$ be a group.  A \textbf{representation} of $G$ is a homomorphism $\rho \colon  G \to GL_n (\mathbb{C})$ for some positive integer n.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
Two representations $\rho_1 \colon  G \to GL_n (\mathbb{C})$  and $\rho_2 \colon  G \to GL_n (\mathbb{C})$ of $G$ are \textbf{equivalent} if there exists $P \in GL_n (\mathbb{C})$ such that $\rho_2 = P^{-1} \rho_1 P$.
\end{defn}
Equivalent representations are fundamentally "the same" in some sense, but to make this precise we need to shift our thinking to linear maps instead of matrices.

\begin{defn}
\label{rep-def-1}
Let $G$ be a group, let $F$ be a field, and let $V$ be a vector space over $F$.  A \textbf{linear representation} of G is any group homomorphism $\rho\colon G \to GL(V)$. If we fix a basis for $V$, we get a representation in the previous sense.\end{defn}
 



\begin{defn}[Alternative definition] \label{rep-def-2}Let $G$ be a group, let $F$ be a field, and let $V$ be a vector space over $F$. A \textbf{linear representation} of $G$ is an action of $G$ on $V$ which preserves the linear structure of $V$, i.e. an action of $G$ on $V$ such that
\begin{align}
\label{rep-axiom-1}&g \cdot (v_1+v_2)=g \cdot v_1+g \cdot v_2 \quad && \forall g \in G, v_1, v_2 \in V \\
\label{rep-axiom-2}&g \cdot (kv) = k (g \cdot v) \quad && \forall g \in G, v \in V, k \in F
\end{align}
 \end{defn}
 
 \begin{note}
 Unless otherwise specificed, we use \textit{representation} to mean \textit{finite-dimensional complex representation}.
 \end{note}
 
 
 \begin{prop}
The definitions of a linear representation given in \ref{rep-def-1} and \ref{rep-def-2} above are equivalent.
 \end{prop}
 \begin{proof}
%\leavevmode
 \begin{itemize}
\item[$(\rightarrow)$]  Suppose that we have a homomorphism $\rho \colon G \to GL(V)$.  Note that $GL(V)$ is a subgroup of the symmetric group $S_V$ on $V$, so we can apply Proposition \ref{hom-yields-action} to obtain an action of $G$ on $V$ by $g \cdot v = \rho(g)(v)$.  We check that this action preserves the linear structure of V.
\\\ref{rep-axiom-1} \quad For any $g \in G$, $v_1, v_2 \in V$ we have $g \cdot (v_1 +  v_2) = \rho(g) (v_1 + v_2) = \rho(g)(v_1) + \rho(g)(v_2)= g \cdot v_1 + g \cdot v_2$.
\\\ref{rep-axiom-2} \quad For any $g \in G, v \in V, k \in F$ we have $g \cdot (kv) = \rho(g)(kv) = k (\rho(g)(v)) = k (g \cdot v)$.
\item[$(\leftarrow)$] Suppose that we have an action of $G$ on $V$ which preserves the linear structure of V in the sense of Definition \ref{rep-def-2}.  We can apply Proposition \ref{action-yields-hom} to obtain a homorphism $\rho \colon G \to S_V$ given by $\rho(g) = \sigma_g$ where $\sigma_g(v) = g \cdot v $.  It remains to show that the image $\rho(G)$ of $G$ under $\rho$ is actually contained in $GL(V)$, i.e. that for each $g \in G$ the map $\sigma_g$ is linear.  Fix an element $g \in G$. For any $k \in F$ and $v \in V$, we have
\begin{align*}
\sigma_g (kv) &= g \cdot (kv) && \text{(by definition of $\sigma_g$)} \\
		&= k (g \cdot v) && \text{(by property \ref{rep-axiom-1})} \\
		&= k (\sigma_g (v)) && \text{(by definition of $\sigma_g$)}.
\end{align*}
Also, for any $v_1, v_2 \in V$ we have
\begin{align*}
\sigma_g (v_1 + v_2) &= g \cdot (v_1 + v_2) && \text{(by definition of $\sigma_g$)} \\
		&= g \cdot v_1 + g \cdot v_2 && \text{(by property \ref{rep-axiom-2})} \\
		&= \sigma_g(v_1) + \sigma_g(v_2) && \text{(by definition of $\sigma_g$)}.
\end{align*}
Thus $\sigma_g$ is linear, and $\rho(G) \subset GL(V)$ proves that we  have a homomorphism $\rho \colon G \to GL(V)$.

\end{itemize}
 \end{proof}
 \begin{defn}Let $G$ be a group, let $F$ be a field, let $V$ be a vector space over $F$, and let $\rho \colon G \to GL(V)$ be a representation of $G$.  The \textbf{dimension} of the representation is the dimension of $V$ over $F$.  
 \end{defn}
% ============== Examples of Representations ===========%
 \begin{example}
 \begin{enumerate}
\item Let $V$ be a $1$-dimensional vector space over the field $F$.  The map $\rho \colon G \to GL(V)$ defined by $\rho(g) = 1$ for all $g \in G$ is a representation called the \textit{trival representation} of $G$.  The trivial representation has dimension $1$.

\item If $G$ is a finite group that acts on a finite set $X$, and $F$ is any field, then there is an associated \textit{permutation representation}  on the vector space $V$ over $F$ with basis $\{e_x \colon x \in X\}$.  We let $G$ act on the basis elements by the permutation $g \cdot e_x = e_{gx}$ for all $x \in X$ and $g \in G$. This representation has dimension $|X|$.  

\item A fundamental special case of a permutation representation that we shall return to later on is that when a finite group acts on itself by left multiplication.  In this case, the elements of $G$ form a basis for $V$, and each $g \in G$ permutes the basis elements by $g \cdot g_i = gg_i$.  This representation is called the \textit{regular representation} of $G$ and has dimension $|G|$. We shall see later that this representation encodes information about all other representations of $G$.

\item For any symmetric group $S_n$, the \textit{alternating representation} on $V=\mathbb{C}$ is given by the map $\rho \colon S_n \to GL(\mathbb{C})=\mathbb{C}^\times$ defined by $\rho(\sigma)=\text{sgn}(\sigma)$. More generally, for any group $G$ with a subgroup $H$ of index $2$, we can define an \textit{alternating representation} $\rho \colon G \to GL(\mathbb{C})$ by letting $\rho(g) = 1$ if $g \in H$ and $\rho(g) = -1$ if $g \notin H$.  (We recover our original example  by taking $G= S_n$ and $H=A_n$.)

\end{enumerate}
 \end{example}

%=========Homomorphisms===================%

\begin{defn}
A \textbf{homomorphism} between two representations $\rho_1 \colon G \to GL(V)$ and $\rho_2 \colon G \to GL(W)$ is a linear map $\psi \colon V \to W$ that interwines with (respects) the $G$-action, i.e. a map $\psi$ such that \[ \psi ( \rho_1 (g)(v)) = \rho_2(g) (\psi(v)) \quad \forall v \in V, g \in G \]  An \textbf{isomorphism} of representations is a homomorphism of representations that is also an invertible map.
\end{defn}
\begin{note}
If we have representations $(\rho_1, V)$ and $(\rho_2, W)$ and an isomorphism of vector spaces $\psi \colon V \to W$ then we can rewrite the compatibility requirement above as $\rho_2(g) = \psi \circ \rho_1(g) \circ \psi^{-1}$ for all $g \in G$.
\end{note}

Given any representation $(\rho, V)$ of a group $G$ on a vector space $V$ over a field $F$ of dimension $n$, we can fix a basis for $V$ to obtain an isomorphism of vector spaces $\psi \colon V \to F^n$.  This yields a representation $\phi$ of $G$ on $F^n$ by defining $\phi (g) = \psi \circ \rho(g) \circ \psi^{-1}$ for all $g \in G$. Clearly, this representation is isomorphic to our original representation $(\rho, V)$. In particular, this means we can always choose to view $n$-dimensional complex representations as representations on $\mathbb{C}^n$ where each $\phi(g)$ is given by an $n \times n$ matrix with entries in $\mathbb{C}$.

Suppose that we have two representations $\rho_1 \colon G \to GL_n(F)$ and $\rho_2 \colon G \to GL_m(F)$ given by $\rho_1(g) = X_g$ and $\rho_2(g) = Y_g$.  A homomorphism between these representations is then an $m \times n$ matrix $A$ such that $A X_g = Y_g A$ for all $g \in G$.   An isomorphism is given precisely when such $A$ is square and invertible.  Thus, two representations $\rho_1 \colon G \to GL_n(F)$ and $\rho_2 \colon G \to GL_n(F)$ are isomorphic if and only if there exists $A \in GL_n(F)$ such that $\rho_1(g) = A \rho_2(g) A^{-1}$ for all $g \in G$.  This establishes the following proposition:
\begin{prop}
The isomorphism classes of $n$-dimensional representations of $G$ on $\mathbb{C}$ are in bijection with the quotient $Hom(G; GL_n(\mathbb{C})) / GL_n(\mathbb{C})$ of group homomorphisms $G \to GL_n(\mathbb{C})$ modulo the conjugation action of $GL_n(\mathbb{C})$.
\end{prop}

%	Representations of Cyclic Groups
%
\section{Representations of Cyclic Groups}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{example}[Representations of $\mathbb{Z}$]
We want to classify all representations of the group $\mathbb{Z}$ under addition.  Consider an $n$-dimensional representation $\rho \colon \mathbb{Z} \to GL_n (\mathbb{C})$.  For $\rho$ to be a group homomorphism requires that $\rho(0) = \text{Id}$.  Observe that for any $0 \neq n \in \mathbb{Z}$, we have $\rho(n) = \rho( 1 + \ldots + 1) = \rho(1)^n$.  Thus $\rho$ is completely determined by the matrix $\rho(1) \in GL_n(\mathbb{C})$, and any such matrix determines a representation of $\mathbb{Z}$.  It follows that the $n$-dimensional isomorphism classes of representations of $\mathbb{Z}$ are in bijection with the conjugacy classes in $GL_n(\mathbb{C})$.  These conjugacy classes can be parameterized by the \textit{Jordan canonical form}.
\end{example}

\begin{example}[Representations of the cyclic group of order $n$]
We shall classify all representations of the cyclic group $G = \{ g, g^2, \ldots, g^{n-1}, g^n=1\}$ of order $n$. Consider a representation $\rho \colon G \to GL(V)$.  As in the previous example, we know that $\rho(1) = \text{Id}$ and $\rho(g^k) = \rho(g)^k$.  Thus our representation $\rho$ is determined completely by the linear transformation $\rho(g)$.   It will be helpful to fix a basis of $V$ so that we may view $\rho(g)$ as a matrix.  Recall from linear algebra that there exists a basis in which $\rho(g)$ takes the \textit{Jordan canonical form}

\[ \rho(g) = \begin{bmatrix}
    J_1 & 0 & \dots  &0 \\
  0 & J_2  & \dots & 0 \\
    \vdots & \vdots  & \ddots & \vdots \\
    0& 0&  \dots  & J_m
\end{bmatrix} \]
where each \textit{Jordan block} $J_k$ is of the form 
\[J_k =  \begin{bmatrix}
    \lambda & 1&0& \dots  &0 & 0 \\
     0 &\lambda& 1& \ddots & 0  & 0 \\
     0 & 0 & \lambda & \ddots& 0  & 0 \\
     0 & 0 & 0 & \ddots & 1 & 0 \\
    \vdots & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots  & 1\\
    0& 0& 0 & \dots  & 0  &\lambda
\end{bmatrix}. \]
Now $I = \rho(g)^n$ is a block-diagonal matrix with diagonal blocks $J_k^n$, so we must have that each block $J_k^n=\text{Id}$.  Observe that we can write each block $J_k$ as $J_k = \lambda \text{Id} + N$ where $N$ is the Jordan block with $\lambda = 0$.  Thus we have 
\[ \text{Id} = J_k^n = (\lambda \text{Id} + N)^n = \lambda ^n \text{Id} + \binom{n}{1} \lambda ^{n -1} N + \binom{n}{2} \lambda ^{n-2} N^2 + \ldots + \binom {n} {n -1} \lambda N^{n -1} + N^n \]. The following lemma will show that in fact $N=0$. 
\begin{lemma}
Let $N$ be the Jordan block with $\lambda = 0$ of size $n \times n$.  For any integer $p$ with $1 \leq p \leq n - 1$, then $N^p$ is the matrix with ones in the positions $(i,j)$ where $j = i + p$ and zeroes everywhere else.  (The ones lie along a line parallel to the diagonal, $p$ steps above it.)

\begin{proof}
(By induction.)

 {\textit{Base case:}} This is simply the definition of $N$.

 \textit{Inductive step:} Suppose that the lemma holds for $N^p$.  We compute the $(i,j)$ entry of $N^{p+1}$:
\[ (N^{p+1})_{i,j} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} (N^{p})_{i,k} N_{k, j} = (N^p)_{i, i +p} N_{i +p, j} = N_{i +p, j} =\begin{cases} 
      1 & \text{if}  j = i + (p +1) \\
      0 & \text{otherwise} \\
   \end{cases}  \]

\end{proof}
\end{lemma}

Now, if $N \neq 0$ then each term $\binom {n}{k} \lambda ^ {n - k } N ^k$ for $k > 0$ would yield some non-zero non-diagonal entries (in the positions $(i,j)$ where $j= i + k$) and hence our sum could not equal the identity matrix.  We must conclude that $N = 0$, $J_k = \lambda \text{Id}$ is a $1 \times 1$ block, and $J_k ^n = \lambda ^ n \text{Id}$.  Thus $\rho(g)$ is a diagonal matrix with $n$th roots of unity as diagonal entries. 

To summarize, every $m$-dimensional representation $\rho$ of the cyclic group $G = \langle g \rangle$ of order $n$ can be seen to act (with the right choice of basis) as $m \times m$ diagonal matrices all with $n$th roots of unity along the diagonal.  In particular, these representations are determined completely by the value of $\rho(g)$ and are classified up to isomorphism by unordered $m$-tuples of $n$th roots of unity.
\end{example}

\section{Constructions from Linear Algebra}
\begin{defn} A \textbf{subrepresentation} of $V$ is a $G$-invariant subspace $W \subseteq V$; that is, a subspace $W \subseteq V$ with the property that $\rho(g) (w) \in W$ for all $g \in G$ and $w \in W$.  Note that $W$ itself is a representation of $G$ under the action $\rho(g) \restriction_W$.
\end{defn}

From elementary linear algebra, we know that given a subspace $W \subseteq V$, we can form the \textbf{quotient space} $V / W$ consisting of cosets $v + W$ in $V$.  If $W$ is a subrepresentation of $V$, we would like to define an action of $G$ on $V / W$ by the natural choice of $g (v + W) = \rho(g)(v)+ W$.  It remains to verify that this action is well defined.  If we choose another $v' \in v + W$, then $v - v' \in W$, so that $\rho(g)(v - v') \in W$ since $W$ is $G$-invariant.  Thus, the cosets $\rho(g)(v) + W$ and $\rho(g)(v') + W$ agree and this action is indeed well defined. This justifies the following definition:

\begin{defn}
Let $W$ be a $G$-subrepresentation of $V$.  Then $V/W$ forms a representation of $G$ called the \textbf{quotient representation} of $V$ under $W$ with the action $g( v + W) = \rho(g)(v) + W$.
\end{defn}

Recall also from linear algebra that given two vector spaces $V_1$ and $V_2$, we can form the \textbf{direct sum} $V_1 \oplus V_2$ consisting of ordered pairs $(v_1 ,v_2)$ where $v_1 \in V_1, v_2 \in V_2$.  

\begin{defn}
Let $V_1$ and $V_2$ be representations of $G$.  Then $V_1 \oplus V_2$ forms a representation of $G$ called the \textbf{direct sum representation} of $V_1$ and $V_2$ with the action $g (v_1, v_2) = (g \cdot  v_1, g \cdot v_2)$.
\end{defn}


\section{Complete Reducibility and Unitarity}
\begin{defn}
A representation is said to be \textbf{irreducible} if it contains no proper invariant subspaces.  It is called \textbf{completely reducible} if it decomposes into a direct sum of irreducible subrepresentations.
\end{defn}

\begin{example}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Any irreducible representation is completely reducible.
\item Any $1$-dimensional representations has no proper subspaces, and is thus irreducible.
\end{enumerate}
\end{example}

\begin{thm}\label{simultaneous} If $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_r$ are linear operators on $V$ and each $A_i$ is diagonalizable, they are simultaneously diagonalizable if and only if they commute.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
 See Conrad \cite[Theorem 5.1] {ConradMinPoly}.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm} Every complex representation of a finite abelian group is completely reducible into irreducible representations of dimension $1$.  
\end {thm}
\begin{proof}
Take an arbitrary element $g \in G$.  Since $G$ is finite, we can find an integer $n$ such that $g^n = 1$ and $\rho(g)^n = Id$.    Hence the minimal polynomial of $\rho(g)$ divides  $x^n -1$.  Recall that $x^n-1$ has $n$ distinct roots over $\mathbb{C}$, which are generated by taking powers of $\xi = e^{\frac{2 \pi i}{n}}$.  This means that the minimal polynomial $\rho(g)$ factors into linear factors only over $\mathbb{C}$ so that $\rho(g)$ is diagonalizable.  We conclude that each $\rho(g)$ is (separately) diagonalizable since $g \in G$ was arbitrary.

Now, given any two elements $g_1, g_2 \in G$ we have 

\begin{align*}
\rho(g_1) \rho(g_2)&= \rho(g_1 g_2)&& \text{(since $\rho$ is a homomorphism)} \\
		&=  \rho(g_2 g_1) && \text{(since $G$ is abeilian)} \\
		&= \rho(g_2) \rho(g_1) && \text{(since $\rho$ is a homomorphism)}.
\end{align*}
Thus the matrices $\left\{ \rho(g)\right\}$ commute, so we may apply theorem \ref{simultaneous} to conclude that $\left\{ \rho(g)\right\}$ are simultaneously diagonalizable, say with basis $\left\{ e_1, ..., e_k \right\}$.  Then we have $V= \mathbb{C}e_1 \oplus \mathbb{C} e_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus \mathbb{C} e_n$, with each subspace $ \mathbb{C}e_1$ invariant under the action of $G$.
\end{proof}

We recall the following definition from linear algebra:
\begin{defn} \label{hip}
Let $V$ be a complex vector space.  A \textbf{Hermitian inner product} on $V$ is a map $\langle \cdot{,}\cdot \rangle \colon  V \times V \to \mathbb{C}$ that satisfies the following properties for all  $u, v, w \in V$ and $c \in \mathbb{C}$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \label{hip-1}  $\langle u + v, w \rangle = \langle u , w \rangle + \langle v, w \rangle$.
\item \label{hip-2} $\langle c u, v \rangle = c \langle u, v \rangle$.
\item \label{hip-3} $\langle u , v \rangle = \overline{\langle v , u \rangle }$.
\item \label{hip-4} $\langle v, v \rangle \geq 0$ with equality if and only if $v = 0$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
A representation $\rho$ of $G$ on a complex vector space $V$ is \textbf{unitary} if $V$ has been equipped with a hermetian inner product $\langle \cdot{,}\cdot \rangle$ which is preserved by the action of $G$, that is, 
\[ \langle v , w \rangle = \langle \rho(g)(v) , \rho(g)(w) \rangle \quad \forall v,w \in V, g \in G. \]
A representation is said to be \textbf{unitarisable} if it can be equipped with such a product (even without one being specified).
\end{defn}

\begin{thm}\label{weyl-unitary-trick} [Weyl's unitary trick] Finite-dimensional represenations of finite groups are unitarisable.
\end {thm}
\begin{proof}
Take any Hermetian inner product on V, say $\langle \cdot{,}\cdot \rangle'$.  We define a new inner product on V by \textit{averaging over} $G$:
\[ \langle v {,}w  \rangle \defeq \frac{1}{|G|} \mathlarger{\sum}_{g \in G} \langle \rho(g)v {,} \rho(g)w \rangle'. \]

This new inner product satifies properties \ref{hip-1},  \ref{hip-2}, and  \ref{hip-3} of Definition \ref{hip} by linearity.  It remains to check positivity (\ref{hip-4}).  Clearly $\langle v {,} v \rangle = 0$ when $v =0$, since each term of the sum will equal zero.  In the case where $v \neq 0$,  observe that

\[ \langle v {,} v \rangle =\frac{1}{|G|} \mathlarger{\sum}_{g \in G} \langle \rho(g)v {,} \rho(g)v \rangle' \geq 0\]

since each term of the sum is non-negative by the positivity of $\langle \cdot{,}\cdot \rangle'$.  The only problem would occur if each term of this sum is equal to zero.  But $\langle \rho(e) v {,} \rho(e) v \rangle ' = \langle v {,} v\rangle' > 0$.  Thus $\langle v {,} v \rangle > 0$.  

Finally, we show that our new inner product is $G$-invariant.  For any $h \in G$, we have
\begin{align*}
\langle \rho(h) v {,} \rho(h) w  \rangle &= \frac{1}{|G|} \mathlarger{\sum}_{g \in G} \langle \rho(g) \rho(h)v {,}\rho(g) \rho(h)w \rangle' \\
&= \frac{1}{|G|} \mathlarger{\sum}_{g \in G} \langle \rho(gh)v {,} \rho(gh)w \rangle' && \text{(since $\rho$ is a homomorphism)} \\
&= \frac{1}{|G|} \mathlarger{\sum}_{k \in G} \langle \rho(k)v {,} \rho(k)w \rangle' && \text{(by a change of variables)}\\
&= \langle v {,} w \rangle.
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{unitary-ortho-complement}
Let $V$ be a unitary representation of $G$ and let $W \subseteq V$ be a $G$-invariant subspace.  Then the orthogonal complement $W^\perp$ is also $G$-invariant.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Choose arbitrary elements $v \in W^\perp$ and $g \in G$.  We need to show that $gv \in W^\perp$.  Now for any $w \in W$, we have $\langle v,w \rangle = 0$.  Thus $\langle gv, gw \rangle = g \overline{g} \langle v , w \rangle = 0$ for any $w \in W$.  Notice that $w' = gw \in W$ since $W$ is $G$-invariant.  This implies that $ \langle gv, w' \rangle =0$, i.e. $gv \in W^\perp$.
\end{proof}


\begin{thm}\label{full-red-of-unitary-reps}
A finite-dimensional unitary representation of a group is fully reducible into unitary irreducible subrepresentations.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
Let $V$ be a finite dimensional unitary representation of $G$. We proceed by induction on the dimension of $V$.  If $\text{dim}(V)=1$, then $V$ is necessarily irreducible.  Now, suppose the theorem holds for all $W$ with $\text{dim}(V) \leq n - 1$ and suppose $\text{dim}(V)=n$. If $V$ is irreducible, we are done. Otherwise, there exists a proper $G$-invariant subspace $W (\neq 0, V)$.  
We can write $V = W \oplus W^\perp$ by Lemma \ref{unitary-ortho-complement}.  Applying the inductive hypothesis to $W$ and $W^\perp$, we obtain a decomposition into irreducibles
\[ V = (W_1 \oplus \ldots \oplus W_j) \oplus (W_{j + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus W_k). \]
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}
Every complex representation of a finite group is completely reducible.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
Any such representation is unitarisable y by Theorem \ref{weyl-unitary-trick}.  We can then apply Theorem \ref{full-red-of-unitary-reps} to obtain full reduciblility.
\end{proof}

\section{Vector Spaces of Linear Maps}
\begin{defn}
Let $V$ and $W$ be vector spaces.  Recall that the set $\textbf{Hom}\mathbf{(V,W)}$ of linear maps from $V$ to $W$ is itself a vector space.  If $f_1, f_2$ are two linear maps from $V$ to $W$, then we define their sum by
\begin{align*}		
(f_1 + f_2) \colon &V \to W \\		
&x \mapsto f_1(x) + f_2(x)		
\end{align*}		
and we define scalar multiplication of $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$ by		
\begin{align*}		
(\lambda f_1) \colon &V \to W \\		
&x \mapsto \lambda f_1(x).		
\end{align*}		
%page 33 of grp 2014'%		
Now suppose we have representations $\rho_V \colon G \to GL(V)$ and $\rho_W \colon G \to GL(W)$ of $G$. Then there is a natural representation of $G$ on the vector space $\text{Hom}(V,W)$ given by
\begin{align*}		
 \rho_{\text{Hom}(V,W)}(g)  \colon \text{Hom}(V,W) &\to \text{Hom}(V,W) \\		
 f &\mapsto \rho_{W}(g) \circ f \circ \rho_{V}(g^{-1})
 \end{align*}		
for all $g \in G$. Note that $\rho_{\text{Hom}(V,W)}(g)(f)$ is certainly a linear map from $V$ to $W$ since the composition of linear maps is linear.
\end{defn}

\begin{prop} $\rho_{\text{Hom}(V,W)}$ is a representation of $G$.  That is, the map		
\begin{align*}		
  \rho_{\text{Hom}(V,W)} \colon G &\to \text{GL}(\text{Hom}(V,W)) \\		
g &\mapsto \rho_{\text{Hom}(V,W)}(g).		
\end{align*}		
 is a homomorphism.		
\end{prop}		
\begin{proof}		
We must check two things:		
\begin{enumerate}			
\item The map $g \mapsto  \rho_{\text{Hom}(V,W)}(g)$ is a homomorphism.	
\item For every $g \in G$,  $\rho_{\text{Hom}(V,W)}(g)$ is invertible.		
\end{enumerate}		
First, we check that
\begin{align*}
\rho_{\text{Hom}(V,W)}(g) \circ \rho_{\text{Hom}(V,W)}(h) \colon f &\mapsto \rho_{\text{Hom}(V,W)} (g) ( \rho_W (h) \circ f \circ \rho_V (h^ {-1})) \\
&= \rho_W (g) \circ \rho_w (h) \circ f \circ \rho_V (h^{-1} ) \circ \rho_V(g^{-1}) \\
&= \rho_W (gh) \circ f \circ \rho_V (g ^{-1} h ^{-1}) \\
&= \rho_{\text{Hom}(V,W)}(gh)(f)
\end{align*}
so indeed $\rho_{\text{Hom}(V,W)}$ is a homomorphism.  We can use this fact to see that $\rho_{\text{Hom}(V,W)}(g^{-1})$ is inverse to $\rho_{\text{Hom}(V,W)}(g)$ as
\begin{align*}
\rho_{\text{Hom}(V,W)}(g) \circ \rho_{\text{Hom}(V,W)}(g^{-1}) \ &= \rho_{\text{Hom}(V,W)} (e) \\ 
&= \text{Id}_{\text{Hom}(V,W)} \\
&= \rho_{\text{Hom}(V,W)}(g^{-1}) \circ \rho_{\text{Hom}(V,W)}(g).
\end{align*}
Thus $\rho_{\text{Hom}(V,W)}(g)$ is invertible for every $g \in G$, and $\rho_{\text{Hom}(V,W)}$ is a representation of $G$.
\end{proof}

\begin{defn}		
Let $V$ and $W$ be two representations of $G$.  The set of $G$-linear maps from $V$ to $W$ forms a subspace of $\text{Hom}(V,W)$, which we denote by $\textbf{Hom}_\mathbf{G}\mathbf{(V,W)}$.  In other words, $\text{Hom}_{G}(V,W)$ is the vector space consisting of all \textit{homomorphisms of representations} between $V$ and $W$. 
\end{defn} 

\begin{defn}
Let $\rho \colon G \to GL(V)$ be a representation.  We define the \textbf{invariant subrepresentation} $V^G \subset V$ to be the set 
\[ \{ v \in V  \mid \rho(g)(v) = v,  \quad \forall g \in G \}. \]
\end{defn}
Note that $V^G$ is a subspace of $V$, and is also clearly a subrepresentation.   It is isomorphic to a trivial representation of some dimension.

\begin{prop}\label{invariant-subrprn}
Let  $\rho_V \colon G \to GL(V)$ and $\rho_W \colon G \to GL(W)$ be representations of $G$.  Then the subrepresentation 
\[ \text{Hom}_G (V,W) \subset \text{Hom} (V,W) \]
is precisely the invariant subrepresentation $\text{Hom}(V,W) ^G$ of $\text{Hom}(V,W)$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Let $f \in \text{Hom}(V,W)$.  Then $f$ is an element of the invariant subrepresentation $\text{Hom}(V,W) ^G$ iff we have
\begin{align*}
&f = \rho_{\text{Hom}(V,W)} (g)(f)  \quad \forall g \in G \\
\iff &f = \rho_W (g) \circ f \circ \rho_V (g^{-1}) \quad \forall g \in G \\ 
\iff & f \circ \rho_V (g) = \rho_W (g) \circ f \quad \forall g \in G
\end{align*}
which is exactly the condition that $f$ is $G$-linear, i.e. that $f \in \text{Hom}_G (V,W)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{invariant-subrprn-of-dir-sum}
Let $A$ and $B$ be two representations of $G$.  Then \[ (A \oplus B)^ G = A^G \oplus B^G. \]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}Observe that
\begin{align*}
(a,b) \in (A \oplus B)^G \iff & \rho_{A \oplus B} (g) (a,b) = (a,b) &  \forall g \in G \\
\iff & (\rho_A (g) (a), \rho_B (g) (b)) = (a,b) &  \forall g \in G \\
\iff & (a,b) \in A^G \oplus B^G.
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{isomorphism-invariant-subrprns}
Let $\psi \colon A \to B$ be an isomorphism between representations of $G$. Then $\psi$ induces an isomorphism between their invariant subrepresentations 
\[ \psi \restriction_{A^G} \colon A^G \to B^G.\]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Clearly the restriction of $\psi$ to $A^G \subset A$ induces an isomorphism to some subrepresentation of $B$, but we must check that the image of this restriction actually equals $B^G$.  We verify that 
\begin{align*}
a \in A^G \iff & \rho_A (g) (a) = a & \forall g \in G \\
\iff & \psi( \rho_A (g)(a)) = \psi (a) & \forall g \in G \\
\iff & \rho_B(g) \psi(a) = \psi(a) & \forall g \in G \\
\iff & \psi(a) \in B^G.
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

\section{Schur's Lemma}
\begin{thm}\label{schur-lemma-over-c}[Schur's Lemma over $\mathbb{C}$.] If $V$ is an irreducible $G$-representation over $\mathbb{C}$, then evey linear operator $\phi \colon V \to V$ commuting with $G$ is a scalar.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
Let $\lambda$ be an eigenvalue of $\phi$.  Observe that the eigenspace $E_\lambda$ is $G$-invariant: If $v \in E_\lambda$, then $\phi(v) = \lambda v$.  This implies that $\phi(g v) = g \phi(v) = g (\lambda v) = \lambda (gv)$, i.e. $gv \in E_\lambda$. Since $g$ was arbitrary, $E_\lambda$ is indeed $G$-invariant.  Now $E_\lambda \neq 0$, so by irreducibility $E_\lambda = V$.  Thus $\phi = \lambda \text{Id}$.  
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}
If $V$ and $W$ are irreducible, the space $\text{Hom}_G(V,W)$ is $1$-dimensional if the representations are isomorphic, and in this case any non-zero map is an isomorphism. Otherwise,  $\text{Hom}^G(V,W)=\{0\}$.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
We claim $\text{ker}(\phi)$ and $\text{im}(\phi)$ are both $G$-invariant. Let $0 \neq \phi \in \text{Hom}_G(V,W)$.  If $v \in \text{ker}(\phi)$, then $\phi(v) = 0$ implies that  $\phi (gv) = g  \phi(v) = g  0 =0$, i.e. $ gv \in \text{ker}(\phi)$. Similarly, if $v \in \text{im}(\phi)$, then $v = \phi(w)$ implies that $\phi (gw) = g \phi(w) = gv$, i.e. $gv \in \text{im}(\phi)$.    

Irreducibility yields $\text{ker}(\phi) = 0 $ or $V$ and $\text{im}(\phi) = 0$ or  $W$ as the only possibilities.  If $\phi \neq 0$, then $\text{ker}(\phi) = 0$.  This means that $\phi$ is injective,  $\text{im}(\phi) = W$, and $\phi$ is an isomorphism. 

Let $\psi$ be another interwining operator from $V$ to $W$.  Then $\phi ^{-1} \circ \psi$ is also an intertwining operator from $V$ to $V$.  We can apply Schur's Lemma over $\mathbb{C}$ to see that $\phi ^{-1} \circ \psi = \lambda \text{Id}$, hence $\psi = \lambda \phi$.
\end{proof}

More definitions are required before we can state a more general Schur's Lemma (not restricted to just $\mathbb{C}$).

\begin{defn}
An \textbf{algebra} over a field $K$ is a ring with unit, containing a distinguished copy of $K$ that commutes with every algebra element, and with $1 \in K$ begin the algebra unit.  A \textbf{division ring} is a ring where every non-zero element is invertible, and a \textbf{division algebra} is a division ring which is also a $K$-algebra.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
Let $V$ be a representation of $G$ over $K$.  The \textbf{endomorphism algebra} $\text{End}^G(V)$ is the space of linear self-maps $\phi \colon V \to V$ which commute with the group action, that is, $\rho(g) \circ \phi = \phi \circ \rho(g) \quad \forall g \in G$.  The addition is the usual addition of linear maps (pointwise), and the multiplication is function composition.  The distinguished copy of $K$ is given by $K \text{Id}$.
\end{defn}

\begin{thm}\label{schur-lemma}[Schur's Lemma] If $V$ is an irreducible finite-dimensional representation of $G$ over $K$, then $\text{End}^G(V)$ is a finite-dimensional division algebra over $K$.
\end{thm}

\section{Tensor Product}
Let $V$ and $W$ be two vector spaces over $K$, and assume we have bases $\{ a_1, \ldots, a_n\}$ for $V$  and $\{b_1, \ldots, b_m \}$ for W.
\begin{defn}
The \textbf{tensor product} $V \bigotimes_{K} W$ of $V$ and $W$ is the $K$-vector space which has a basis given by the set of symbols 
\[ \{ a_i \otimes b_j | 1 \leq i \leq n, 1 \leq j \leq m \}. \]

When the ground field $K$ is clear, in can be omitted from the notation.  If we have vectors $x \in V$ and $y \in W$, we can define a vector $x \otimes y \in V \bigotimes W$ as follows.  Write $x$ and $y$ in the given bases with coefficients $\lambda_i, \mu_j \in K$, so
\[ x = \lambda_1 a_1 + \ldots + \lambda_n a_n \]
\[ y = \mu_1 b_1 + \ldots + \mu_m b_m .\]
Then we define 
\[ x \otimes y = \sum\limits_{\substack{i \in [1,n] \\ j \in [1,m]}} \lambda_i \mu_j a_i \otimes b_j. \]
\end{defn}

Now let $V$ and $W$ be two representations of $G$.
\begin{defn}
We can define a representation of $G$ on $V \otimes W$ called the \textbf{tensor product representation}. We define
\[ \rho_{V \otimes W} (g) \colon V \otimes W \to V \otimes W \]
to be the linear map given by
\[ \rho_{V \otimes W} (g) \colon a_i \otimes b_j \mapsto \rho_V (g) (a_i) \otimes \rho_W (g) (b_j).\]
\end{defn}


\section{Isotypical Decomposition}

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma-uvw}
Let $U, V, W$ be three vector spaces.  Then we have natural isomorphisms
\begin{enumerate}
\item \label{lemma-uvw1} $\text{Hom} (V, U \oplus W) = \text{Hom} (V,U) \oplus \text{Hom} (V,W)$
\item \label{lemma-uvw2} $\text{Hom} (U \oplus W, V) = \text{Hom} (U,V) \oplus \text{Hom} (W,V)$.
\end{enumerate}
Additionally, if $U,V,W$ carry representations of $G$, then (\ref{lemma-uvw1}) and (\ref{lemma-uvw2}) are isomorphisms of representations.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We have inclusion and projection maps
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
U \arrow[r, hookrightarrow,  shift left,"\iota_{U}"]
& U \oplus W \arrow[r, twoheadrightarrow, shift left,"\pi_{W}"]
\arrow[l, twoheadrightarrow, shift left,"\pi_{U}"]
& W
\arrow[l, hookrightarrow, shift left, "\iota_{W}"]
\end{tikzcd}
 \]
 given by
\begin{align*}
 \iota_U &\colon x \mapsto (x , 0) \\
 \pi_U &\colon (x , y) \mapsto x
 \end{align*}
 and similarly for $\iota_W$ and $\pi_W$.  It is clear that
 \[ \text{Id}_{U \oplus W} = \iota_U \circ \pi_U + \iota_W \circ \pi_W. \]
We also note that the four spaces under consideration all have dimension $(\text{dim } V)(\text{dim } W + \text{dim } U)$.

(\ref{lemma-uvw1}) We define a map
\begin{align*}
 \psi \colon \text{Hom}(V, U \oplus W) &\to \text{Hom}(V,U) \oplus \text{Hom}(V,W) \\
 f  &\mapsto (\pi_U \circ f, \pi_W \circ f). 
\end{align*}
We claim that this map has an inverse	given by 
\begin{align*}
 \psi^{-1} \colon \text{Hom}(V,U) \oplus \text{Hom}(V,W) &\to \text{Hom}(V, U \oplus W) \\
 (f_U ,f_W) &\mapsto \iota_U \circ f_U + \iota_W \circ f_W.
\end{align*}
Check that
\begin{align*}
\psi^{-1} \circ \psi \colon f &\mapsto \iota_U \circ \pi_U \circ f + \iota_W \circ \pi_W \circ f \\
&= (\iota_U \circ \pi_U + \iota_W \circ \pi_W) \circ f\\
&= \text{Id}_{\text{Hom}(V,W)} \circ f = f.
\end{align*}
Since both vector spaces have the same dimension, $\psi \circ \psi^{-1}$ must be the identity map as well, and $\psi$ is an isomorphism of vector spaces.  Now suppose we have representations $\rho_V, \rho_W, \rho_U$ of $G$ on $V, W$ and $U$.  Then we claim $\psi$ is $G$-linear.  Recall that by definition, 
\[ \rho_{\text{Hom}(V, U \oplus W)}(g)(f) = \rho_{U \oplus W} (g) \circ f \circ \rho_V (g^{-1}).\]
Observe that for any $g \in G$ and  $f \in \text{Hom}(V, U \oplus W)$,
\begin{align*}
 \pi_U \circ ( \rho_{\text{Hom}(V, U \oplus W)}(g)(f) )&= \pi_U \circ \rho_{U \oplus W} (g) \circ f \circ \rho_V (g^{-1}) \\
 &= \rho_U (g) \circ \pi_U  \circ f \circ \rho_V (g^{-1}) \quad (\text{since } \pi_U \text{ is }G\text{-linear}) \\
 &=\rho_{\text{Hom}(U,V)}(g)(f)
 \end{align*}
 and similarly for $W$, so that 
 \begin{align*}
\psi ( \rho_{\text{Hom}(V, U \oplus W)}(g)(f)) &= (\pi_U \circ \rho_{\text{Hom}(V, U \oplus W)}(g)(f), \pi_W \circ \rho_{\text{Hom}(V,U \oplus W)}(g)(f)) \\
&=(\rho_{\text{Hom}(V,U)}(g)(\pi_U \circ f), \rho_{\text{Hom}(V,W)}(g)(\pi_W \circ f)) \\
&= \rho_{\text{Hom}(V,U) \oplus \text{Hom}(V,W)}(g)(\pi_U \circ f, \pi_W \circ f).
 \end{align*}
Thus $\psi$ is $G$-linear, and we've proved (\ref{lemma-uvw1}).

(\ref{lemma-uvw2})  Define a map
\begin{align*}
\phi \colon \text{Hom}(U \oplus W, V) &\to \text{Hom}(U,V) \oplus \text{Hom}(W,V) \\
&= (f \circ \iota_U, f \circ \iota_W).
\end{align*}
We [finish me].  The book says proof is like (1)
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}\label{invariant-subrprns-hom-spaces}
If  $U, V, W$ are representations of $G$, then there are natural isomorphisms
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\text{Hom}_G(V, U \oplus W) = \text{Hom}_G(V,U) \oplus \text{Hom}_G(V,W)$
\item $\text{Hom}_G(U \oplus W, V) = \text{Hom}_G(U, V) \oplus \text{Hom}_G(W ,V)$
\end{enumerate}
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
(1). By Lemma (\ref{lemma-uvw}), we have an isomorphism of representations 
\[ \psi \colon \text{Hom}(V, U \oplus W) \to \text{Hom}(V, U) \oplus \text{Hom}(V,W). \]
We can apply Lemma (\ref{isomorphism-invariant-subrprns}) to obtain an isomorphism on the invariant subrepresentations
\[\text{Hom}(V, U \oplus W)^G \cong (\text{Hom}(V, U) \oplus \text{Hom}(V,W))^G.\]
Then Lemma (\ref{invariant-subrprn-of-dir-sum}) implies that 
\[\text{Hom}(V, U \oplus W)^G \cong \text{Hom}(V, U)^G \oplus \text{Hom}(V,W)^G. \]
The statement now follows from Proposition (\ref{invariant-subrprn}).

(2). The argument is similar to the one above.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}\label{schurs-lemma-homvw}
Let $V$ and $W$ be irreducible representations of $G$.  Then
\[ \text{dim Hom}_G (V,W) =  \begin{cases} 
1 & \mbox{if $V$ and $W$ are isomorphic}  \\
0 &\mbox{if $V$ and $W$ are not isomorphic}
\end{cases} \]
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Suppose $V$ and $W$ are not isomorphic.  Then Schur's Lemma states that the only $G$-linear map from $V$ to $W$ is the zero map, hence $\text{Hom}_G(V,W) = \{ 0 \} $.

On the other hand, suppose that $f \colon V \to W$ is an isomorphism.  Then for any $h \in \text{Hom}_G(V,W)$, we have $f^{-1} \circ h \in \text{Hom}_G(V,V)$.  By Schur's Lemma, $f^{-1} \circ h = \lambda \text{Id}_V$, i.e. $h = \lambda f$ for some $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$.  Thus $f$  spans $\text{Hom}_G(V,W)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
Let $\rho \colon G \to GL(V)$ be a representation, and let \[ V = U_1 \oplus \ldots \oplus U_s \] be a decomposition of $V$ into irreducibles.  Let $W$ be any irreducible representation of $G$.  Then the number of irreducible representations in the set  $ \{ U_1, \ldots, U_s \}$ which are isomorphic to $W$ is equal to the dimension of $\text{Hom}_G(V,W)$, and also equal to the dimension of $\text{Hom}_G(W,V)$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
We know from Proposition (\ref{schurs-lemma-homvw}) that the number of irreducibles representations in the set  $ \{ U_1, \ldots, U_s \}$ which are isomorphic to $W$ is equal to \[ \sum_{i=1}^s \text{dim Hom}_G(U_i,W). \]
By Corollary (\ref{invariant-subrprns-hom-spaces}), \[ \text{Hom}_G(V,W) = \bigoplus_{i=1}^s \text{Hom}_G(U_i, W) \]
so that \[  \text{dim Hom}_G(V,W) = \sum_{i=1}^s \text{dim Hom}_G(U_i, W). \]
The same argument works if we consider $\text{Hom}_G(W,V)$ and $\text{Hom}_G(W,U_i)$ in place of $\text{Hom}_G(V,W)$ and $\text{Hom}_G(U_i,W)$.
\end{proof}




\section{Character Theory}
\begin{defn}
The \textbf{character} of a representation $\rho \colon G \to GL(V)$ is the function $\chi_V \colon G \to \mathbb{C}$ defined by $\chi_V(g) = \text{Tr}(\rho(g))$.
\end{defn}
\begin{note}
The character is of a representation is not a homorphism in general, since $\text{Tr}(MN) \neq \text{Tr}(M) \text{Tr}(N)$ in general.
\end{note}

\begin{prop} (Basic Properties)
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\chi_V$ is conjugation invariant: $\chi_V (h g h^{-1}) = \chi_V (g)$ for all $g , h \in G$.
\item $\chi_V (1) = \text{\emph{dim }} V$.
\item $\chi_V (g^{-1}) = \overline{\chi_V (g)}$ for all $g \in G$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\chi_V (h g h^{-1} = \text{Tr}(h g h^{-1}) = \text{Tr}(g h h^{-1}) = \text{Tr} (g) = \chi_V(g)$ for any $g,h \in G$.
\item $\chi_V(1) = \text{Tr}(\text{Id} _V) = \text{dim } V$.
\item Since $G$ is finite, we have seen that $\rho(g)$ is a diagonal matrix with roots of unity along the diagonal with the right choice of basis.  The inverse of a root of unity is given by its complex conjugate, so under this same basis, $\rho(g)^{-1}$ is clearly given by $\overline{\rho(g)}$.  Thus, $\chi_V(g^{-1}) = \text{Tr}(\rho(g^{-1})) = \text{Tr}(\rho(g)^{-1}) = \text{Tr}(\overline{\rho(g)}) = \overline{ \text{Tr} (\rho(g))} = \overline {\chi_V(g)}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{defn}
A \textbf{class function} on $G$ is a function on $G$ whose values are invariant by conjugation of elements in $G$.  The value of a class function at an element $g \in G$ depends only on the conjugacy class of $g$.  We may therefore view class functions as functions on the set of conjugacy classes of $G$.
\end{defn}
\begin{note}
The character $\chi_V$ of a representation $V$ of $G$ is a class function on $G$.
\end{note}

\begin{prop}
Isomorphic representations have the same character.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
We have seen (CITE ME!!!) that isomorphic representations can be described by the same matrices in the right choice of basis.
\end{proof}
We will see later that the converse is true - if two representations have the same character, then they are isomorphic.

\begin{prop}
Let $\rho_V \colon G \to GL(V)$ and $\rho_W \colon G \to GL(W)$ be representations of $G$ with characters $\chi_V$ and $\chi_W$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\chi _{V \oplus W} = \chi_V + \chi_W$.
\item $\chi_{V \otimes W} = \chi_V \cdot \chi_W$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Pick bases for $V$ and $W$, so that $\rho_V (g)$ and $\rho_W (g)$ are described by matrices $M$ and $N$.  Then $\rho_{V \oplus W} (g)$ is described by the block-diagonal matrix
\[ \begin{bmatrix}
M & 0 \\
0 & N \\
\end{bmatrix} \]

So we have $\text{Tr} (\rho_{V \oplus W} (g)) = \text{Tr} (M) + \text{Tr}(N) = \text{Tr}(\rho_V (g)) + \text{Tr} (\rho_W (g))$.

\item $\rho_ {V \otimes W}$ is given by the matrix

\[ [M \otimes N ]_{js, it} = M_{ji} N_{st} \]

\begin{prop}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $\{ V_i \}$ be the irreducible representations of $G$, with $d_i$  the dimension of  $V_i$ and $\chi_i$ the corresponding irreducible character.  Then
\[ \chi_{\text{reg}} = d_1 \chi_1 + \ldots + d_r \chi_r \]

\item \[  
\chi_{\text{reg}} (g) = \begin{cases} 
|G| &\mbox{if } g = e \\ 
0 & \mbox{if } g \neq e 
\end{cases}  \]

\end{enumerate}
